Functions in Python 
A function in python is declared by the keyword 'def' before the name of the function. The return type of the function need not be specified explicitly in python. The function can be invoked by writing the function name followed by the parameter list in the brackets. 

# Function for checking the divisibility
# Notice the indentation after function declaration
# and if and else statements
def checkDivisibility(a, b):
    if a % b == 0 :
        print ("a is divisible by b")
    else:
        print ("a is not divisible by b")
#Driver program to test the above function
checkDivisibility(4, 2)
